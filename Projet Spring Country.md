## Projet Spring Country
Hi!  This is the project that I wrote whit **Intellij** during my formation on the **Spring** framework.
A simple form that stores the entered data and displays it in a table.
Open the terminal in the folder and enter the following command:
```$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run```
Then open the browser at the address :
> http://localhost:8080/

Use !
